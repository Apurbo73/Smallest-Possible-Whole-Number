### Smallest Possible Whole Number:


 This C++ program processes multiple test cases to compute a simple modulus operation, depending on the value of K.

For each test case, it reads two integers: N and K. If K is zero, it directly outputs N because division or modulus by zero is undefined. Otherwise, it computes N % K (i.e., the remainder when N is divided by K) and prints the result. The loop runs T times for each test case, making the program efficient and direct.
